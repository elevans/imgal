/// Compute the effective sample size (ESS) of a weighted sample set.
///
/// # Description
///
/// This function computes the effective sample size (ESS) of a weighted sample
/// set. Only the weights of the associated sample set are needed. The ESS is
/// defined as:
///
/// ```math
/// ESS = (Σ wᵢ)² / Σ (wᵢ²)
/// ```
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `weights`: A slice of non-negative weights where each element represents
///    the weight of an associated sample.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `f64`: The effective number of independent samples.
